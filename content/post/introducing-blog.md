Welcome to the new bell developer blog! When bell first came out as [bell.lahs.club](https://bell.lahs.club), we used to have a small blog where we made a few posts about the development process. Since then, the primary bell developers have graduated from Los Altos High School and have passed along the responsibility of managing the LAHS schedules to the [LAHS Hack Club](https://lahs.club), so it makes sense to have a separate blog just about the development process while the Hack Club makes announcements specific to LAHS on [their Instagram account](https://instagram.com/bellpluslahs).

If you're interested in learning about the latest feature announcements and plans for bell, stay tuned on this blog. We will try to make a post on the 1st of every month. If you're interested in learning more about bell, a good place to start is the [README on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/nicolaschan/bell/blob/master/README.md).
