What a weird experience. Last semester, I was fed up with remembering the schedule so I made a timer. Then lots of people started using my timer. And before I knew it, the news of my fancy timer had spread like wildfire across the school, generating hundreds of hits per day from teachers and students alike.

I’d like to know what you all thought about using my timer, so [I made a short survey](https://goo.gl/forms/z0WEO9XZFKxJP9VG2). I really value your feedback because if it weren’t for you, the hundreds of timer users, page 35 of the yearbook would be a lot less exciting without me on it.

Next year, I’m off to college and the future of my timer is uncertain. I think I will maintain it for at least next year, but it will be more difficult without being here at Los Altos to hear the announcements. I have some plans in mind for a more long-term solution which involves allowing users to set personal schedules.

If you have any ideas or want to contact me for any other reason, you can include your message in your survey response or email me at [bell@lahs.club](mailto:bell@lahs.club). If you happen to know a bit of JavaScript, you can also [contribute to the project](https://github.com/nicolaschan/bell).

Have a great summer!
